    summary: "dict.cc is not only an online dictionary. It's an attempt to create a platform where
       users from all over the world can share their knowledge in the field of translations. Every
       visitor can suggest new translations and correct or confirm other users' suggestions. The
       challenging and most important part of the project is the so-called Contribute! system making
       this process possible. To guarantee that the users' work is not lost in case something happens
       to the maintainer of dict.cc (Paul Hemetsberger), the resulting vocabulary database can be
       downloaded anytime."
